The AT&T Public License is a nonfree license. It has several serious problems:

    The patent license is voided by any modification, no matter how small, of the pertinent code.
    You must demand a written agreement when you distribute the sources or patches.
    It requires notifying AT&T if you distribute a patch.
    Your license can be terminated through no fault of yours, under section 8/3.
    It makes compliance with export control laws a condition of the license.
    Some versions of the license require you to provide support.
    Some versions of the license say you cannot sell a copy of the software for more than the expense of distribution.

The license has two other obnoxious features:

    It has a very broad reverse license to AT&T, which goes far beyond the use of your code, even your code modified.
    It asserts one needs a license from AT&T to make a link to their web site. This is not an immediate practical problem, since the license says it gives permission to make such a link. (Anyway, people shouldn't make links to sites about nonfree software.) But such a claim should not be made or propagated.
