# Master's thesis
How to have legal agreements from contributors for a change in license?

Is it ok to base systematic literature review on licenses rather than scientific publications?

Is it a good idea to sum-up the paragraphs of other SLR theses?

Conduct systematic literature review on licenses in google sheets then improve validity by making a public javascript version of the spreadsheet
