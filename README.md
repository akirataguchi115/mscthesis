## General notes
### Pomodoros
- write 1.3 state of current terminology (insert wayback machine cites)
- write 1.3 terms of non-focus areas of thesis
- write 1.3 examples of these terms
- write 1.3 acknowledge some other essential but non-focus

### Break activity
- meditate
- create linkedin cv
- apply to napa
- Aku Ankka
- Kaiju No. 8

### TODO
- How to make CLAs faster to use? Use GPG as verification?
- Docker SLA, SSPL CLA and what can we learn from those?
- LICENSE highlighting.js?

## Diary
### week 8
fri: the plan to get out of bed immediately does not work if one is sleepy. go earlier to sleep and only practice mindful activities while relaxing. from nurmivaara's slr it seems that you need to define an abbrevation only once in the thesis (even in abstract).

thu: the whole day was pretty cucked from the get go since i overslept. from now on i should just get out of bed the second my smooth brain spawns into this existence in the bed.

wed: started reading about how docker licenses their products. it's crazyyyy. apparentl docker desktop is the that has SLA **and** the only one that has proprietary support for windows and mac, well mac has colima, but for windows this is the only way. moved smaller tasks back here cuz i couldn't be asked to switch between joplin and vscode. 3 pomodoros today. 2 pages out of 30 done lets go babyy.

tue: checking plagiarism against nurmivaara's thesis with some open source software would be a good idea since i have borrowed many of the structures of sentence regarding the slr process from them. i should also check this with my supervisor.

mon: moved smaller tasks to joplin from here. keeping this only for diary type logging. feels good to start a new week. i think i did two pomodoros. could have done three but im still happy about the progress. got a second slr to take some example from. also reached out to simo kähönen for a copy of their slr thesis, because they have the third thesis out of three theses in helda that are tagged with slr. 2 pages in and rising yayy. ill have to adjust the research questions during the conduction of the slr itself. i hope this is normal.

### week 7
fri fix latex, find another slr study: fixed latex, read wikipedia articles on cla, easycla, project harmony and got an idea to sign clas with gpg keys

thu finish 1.0: finished 1.0. one pomodoro.

wed: did nothing. recovering from yesterday.

tue finish 1.0: did nothing. had a depression attack. read one pomodoro worth about gplv3 changes compared to gplv2.

mon finish 1.0 & title1 1.1,-2,-3 paragraphs: rms responded to me saying they'll take a look at the sspl if it actually would be considered free. titled all paragaphs. did not finish 1.0. will do that tomorrow.

### week 6
fri title 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 paragraphs: did nothing cuz i had to look after the baby at home the whole day.

thu title methods paragraphs: managed to find out a better citation for the freedom definition

wed -: took a break from mental health reasons. finished the sudoku and learned about hidden & naked singles, pairs, triples and quads. im a sudoku god.

tue continue writing 1.0: basically just tried to figure out what's the deal with sspl and is it any good.

mon continue writing 1.0: the morning started pretty good in the 3rd floor with a pomodoro. we'll see how long this drive lasts.

### week 5
fri try to get motivated: no motivation. added thesis diary and study plan to readme. tried to solve sudoku all day. this is how far i got.
![Alt text](images/sudoku.jpg)

thu write 1.0: didn't write jack

wed finish 1.0: continued writing 1.0 but very slowly. idk if i can even do this.

tue write 1.1, finish 1.0: organize chrome tabs

mon write 1.0, send email to supervisor: started writing 1.0. sent email to supervisor.

### week 4
fri 26.1 write introduction 1.0, send email to supervisor: didn't write introduction nor send email to supervisor. had to take baby to nutritional therapist.

thu 25.1 take notes from 3 other slr studies' introductions, write introduction: didn't write introduction. tooks notes from 2 other finnish slr studies introduction 1.0s. will have to find another longer slr on software engineering since the third i found on ieee is too short.

wed 24.1 write introduction: didn't manage to write any introduction. instead found some articles and forum discussions about the rhel gpl violation incident.

tue 23.1 think about research questions: I started taking a model from Nurmivaara's systematic literature review on green software. I now have my first set of 4 research questions.

mon 22.1 think about research questions

### week 3
fri 19.1 read about slr

thu 18.1 fix latex

mon 22.1 read about slr: I read the SLR slideshow through. The title is now multivocal slr on software licenses in software engineering. The research questions are not clear yet. I am scared again.
