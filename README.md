# Master's thesis
Is it ok to base systematic literature review on licenses rather than scientific publications?

Is it a good idea to sum-up the paragraphs of other SLR theses?

Conduct systematic literature review on licenses in google sheets then improve validity by making a public javascript version of the spreadsheet

Come up with an scale to measure license length

How to make CLAs more transparent and easier to use?

FSF approved license without GPL compatibility?
