% primary objective of this study
The primary objective of this study was to conduct an extensive review of public licenses in software engineering and offer support to both practitioners and reserachers. The study addressed the following research questions:
\textbf{RQ1: How many public software licenses are there in the top five software license listing cites?} The results of this study

\textbf{RQ2: How much is there disagreement in the shortcode names between different public software licenses listing sites?}

\textbf{RQ3: How many public licenses in software engineering does there exist?}

% adopting a clear baseline
Future research and industry efforts should start at adopting a clear baseline. 

% why agplv3 is the best license

% dockerc cla, sspl, post-open

% make cla easier with gpg / joplin easy cla sign

% LICENSE highlighting.js

% what kind of efforts and why

% what this thesis has provided
