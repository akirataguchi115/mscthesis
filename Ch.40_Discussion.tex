\section{Limitations and threats to validity}

The major limitation of this study is that the subjective results could not be validated by multiple researchers. In a systematic review, it is standard practice and highly recommended to have at least two, if not more, individuals independently conduct the review processes and then cross validating the findings. This would result in the possibility of comparing individual exclusion decisions and other decicions, thereby increasing the credibility of the study. However, in this study, the methodology was thoroughly documented, which allows us to assert with confidence that the study has an appropriate level of of validity.

As a work of single researcher, there is also a chance of inaccuracy and bias in the literature selection and filtering process. As much of the literature had to be reviewed manually and then included/excluded on a qualitative basis, this is a known limitation and a threat to validity. Multiple rounds of documented filtering and a clear paper trail of all decisions made keeps this threat in the acceptable levels.

\subsection{Limitations of literature selection for review}
Efforts were made to ensure the inclusion of comprehensive set of literature in the search process. This was achieved by setting the starting point of PCL lists to the Wikipedia article of the MIT license.

However, as with all systematic literature reviews, a comprehensive manual review of all literature would have been a formidable task. Therefore, additional filtering was conducted.
