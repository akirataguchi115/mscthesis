## 1 introduction
- setting
- thesis objective in short
- slr guidelines
### 1.1 background
- intro to section
- define public license
- define public software license
- explain copyleft
- free vs open
### 1.2 lack of license knowledge
- problem
- easier sub-problem
- legal aspect scope
### 1.3 thesis goal and contributions
- primary object of this research
- thesis contribution
### 1.4 thesis structure
- thesis structure
## 2 methods
- aim of the chapter
- explain slr
- kitchenham 2007
- how our slr came to be
- reliability & validity
### 2.1 research questions
- purpose of rqs
- aim of rq1
- aim of rq2
- aim of rq3
### 2.2 search strategy
- where was search process conducted in (inclusion/exclusion in appendix a)
- data extraction process
### 2.2.1 search method
- more on where was search process conducted in
### 2.2.2 search scope and terms
- how were search terms determined
- qgs on search string
- web scrape beginning
- how many results
- finalized search string
### 2.3 search process
- study selection divided into multiple stages (figure)
- first stage
- second stage
- third stage
### 2.4 inclusion and exclusion criteria
- incl excl regex string
- fetch licenses from scancode
- comments on applying
### 2.5 data collection and data analysis
- what was done to answer rq (table data extraction form)
- third stage how to
- next chapter presents outcomes
## 3 results
- information about chapter
- note about publication year and literature amount
- statistical overview (2 figures)
- recap search process
### 3.1 five license listing sites and their licenses (rq1)
- spdx gave least headache
- the rest listing sites gave headache
- tell more in validity threats
### 3.2 duplicates in license listing sites (rq2)
- note the amount of duplicates per site
- note some other thing about this particular finding
### 3.3 total amount of public software licenses (rq3)
- note the amount of software licenses in appendix c
- note about some non software licenses
## 4 discussion
- indications
- follow-up observation
- notable observation
### 4.1 implications for research
- how to improve scientific scene 1
- how to improve scientific scene 2
- how to improve scientific academic vs multivocal
### 4.2 implications for software engineering professionals
- how to improve professional scene 1
- how to improve professional scene 2
- overall implication
### 4.3 limitations and threats to validity
- major limitation
- possible threats to validity
### 4.3.1 limitations of license selection for review
- efforts to inclusion
- as with all slr all licenses cannot be reviewed manually
- license selection was done in sufficient manner
### 4.3.2 limitations in data extraction
- importance of data extraction
- lack of measurements and tooling
## 5 conclusions
- primary objective of this study
- conclusions from each rq
### 5.1 future research
- adopting a clear baseline
- docker cla, sspl
- make cla easier maybe with gpg / joplin easy cla sign
- license highlighting.js
- what kind of efforts and why
- what this thesis has provided
