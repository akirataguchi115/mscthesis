### 1 Introduction
- setting
- definition
- problem
- easier sub-problem
- thesis' contribution
#### 1.1 Research goal, questions, and contributions
- primary object of this research (rqs)
- 1.2 will examine terms
- viewpoints
#### 1.2 Thesis structure
- thesis structure
#### 1.3 Background and terminology of public licenses
- state of current terminology
- explain copyleft
- terms of other interest areas of the thesis
- why the scope is so narrow
- acknowledge one example of non-focus
- legal aspect scope
- state of terminology standardization
- FLOSS diagram
- free vs open
- define public licenses in se
- acknowledge the topic is complex

### 2 Methods
- aim of the chapter
- explain slr
- study follows kitchenham 2007
- how the review process came to be
- reliability & validity
#### 2.1 Research questions
- purpose of rqs
- aim of rq1
- aim of rq2
- aim of rq3
#### 2.2 Search strategy
- where was search process conducted in (inclusion/exclusion in appendix a)
- data extraction process
##### 2.2.1 Search method
- more on where was search process conducted in
##### 2.2.2 Search scope and terms
- how were search terms determined
- qgs on search string
- web scrape beginning
- how many results
- finalized search string
#### 2.3 Search process
- Study selection divided into multiple stages (figure)
- first stage
- second stage
- third stage
#### 2.4 Inclusion and exclusion criteria
- incl excl regex string
- fetch licenses from scancode
- comments on applying
#### 2.5 Data collection and data analysis
- what was done to answer rq (table data extraction form)
- third stage how to
- next chapter presents outcomes

### 3 Results
- information about chapter
- note about publication year and literature amount
- statistical overview (2 figures)
- recap search process
#### 3.1 Five license listing sites and their licenses (RQ1)
- spdx gave least headache
- the rest listing sites gave headache
- tell more in validity threats
#### 3.2 Duplicates in license listing sites (RQ2)
- note the amount of duplicates per site
- note some other thing about this particular finding
#### 3.3 Total amount of public software licenses (RQ3)
- note the amount of software licenses in appendix c
- note about some non software licenses

### 4 Discussion
- indications
- follow-up observation
- observation 1
- observation 2
- sum-up from those two
#### 4.1 Implications for research
- how to improve scientific scene 1
- how to improve scientific scene 2
- how to improve scientific scene 3
#### 4.2 Implications for software engineering professionals
- how to improve professional scene 1
- how to improve professional scene 2
- how to improve professional scene 3
- overall
#### 4.3 Limitations and threats to validity
- major limitation
- possible threats to validity
##### 4.3.1 Limitations of license selection for review
- efforts to inclusion
- as with all slr all licenses cannot be reviewed manually
- license selection was done in sufficient manner
##### 4.3.2 Limitations in data extraction
- importance of data extraction
- lack of measurements and tooling

### 5 Conclusions
- primary objective of this study
- conclusions from each rq
#### 5.1 Future research
- adopting a clear baseline
- Docker CLA, SSPL
- make cla easier maybe with gpg
- LICENSE highlighting.js
- what kind of efforts and why
- what this thesis has provided
